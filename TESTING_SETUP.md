# Testing Environment Setup Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully set up a comprehensive testing environment for the 10xcards project using Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for end-to-end tests, following the specifications in the tech stack documentation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Testing Dependencies Installed
- **Vitest** - Fast unit testing framework with Jest-compatible API
- **Playwright** - End-to-end testing with multi-browser support
- **Testing Library** - React component testing utilities (@testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/user-event)
- **MSW** - Mock Service Worker for API mocking
- **Coverage reporting** - v8 provider for monitoring code coverage

### 2. Configuration Files Created

#### Vitest Configuration (`vitest.config.ts`)
- Configured for React components with jsdom environment
- Set up path aliases (@/* mapping)
- Configured coverage with 80% thresholds for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- Excluded appropriate files from coverage (node_modules, dist, .astro, types files)

#### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)
- Multi-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Mobile device testing (Pixel 5, iPhone 12)
- Automatic server startup for e2e tests
- HTML, JSON, and JUnit reporting
- Screenshot and video capture on failures

### 3. Test Structure Created

```
src/test/
├── setup.ts              # Vitest global setup
├── setup.test.ts         # Basic test verification
├── utils.tsx             # Testing utilities and mock data factories
└── mocks/
    ├── server.ts         # MSW server configuration
    └── handlers.ts       # API mock handlers

tests/e2e/
└── auth.spec.ts          # Example e2e tests

src/components/features/auth/
└── AuthForm.test.tsx     # Example unit test
```

### 4. Package.json Scripts Added
```json
{
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
  "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
  "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed",
  "test:all": "npm run test && npm run test:e2e"
}
```

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Automated testing on pull requests and pushes
- Linting checks
- Unit tests with coverage reporting
- E2E tests across multiple browsers
- Build verification
- Artifact uploads for test reports

### 6. Mock Data & Utilities
- MSW handlers for API endpoints (auth, flashcards, OpenRouter)
- Test data factories for consistent mock objects
- Custom render function for React components
- Jest DOM matchers for better assertions

## Testing Commands

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test              # Run all unit tests
npm run test:ui           # Run with UI interface
npm run test:coverage     # Run with coverage report
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e          # Run all e2e tests
npm run test:e2e:ui       # Run with UI interface
npm run test:e2e:headed   # Run with visible browser
```

### All Tests
```bash
npm run test:all          # Run both unit and e2e tests
```

## Coverage Requirements
- **80% threshold** for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- HTML coverage reports generated in `coverage/` directory
- Current coverage: 86.76% statements, but needs improvement in branches (29.48%) and functions (23.61%)

## Next Steps
1. Write more comprehensive unit tests for components and utilities
2. Add integration tests for API endpoints
3. Expand e2e test coverage for critical user flows
4. Set up test data seeding for consistent test environments
5. Add performance testing with Playwright

## Files Created/Modified
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `src/test/` - Test utilities and setup
- `tests/e2e/` - E2E test files
- `package.json` - Added test scripts
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `tests/README.md` - Testing documentation

The testing environment is now ready for development and follows all the specifications from the tech stack documentation!
